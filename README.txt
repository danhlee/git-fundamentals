"Hello, Git" 
"Hello again!!!"
updating readme with new information
sharing remotely is fun and easy


1st change after pushing to github


MADE MORE CHANGES!!!!

this text was added after changing origin to use SSH

additional changes after SSH setup

Let's see if my ssh key was added to my ssh-agent so I don't have to type my pass everytime...
-It didn't work...

This time I'll try pushing from git bash instead of cmd prompt
