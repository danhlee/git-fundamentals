1st change after pushing to github


MADE MORE CHANGES!!!!

this text was added after changing origin to use SSH

additional changes after SSH setup

Let's see if my ssh key was added to my ssh-agent so I don't have to type my pass everytime...
-It didn't work...

This time I'll try pushing from git bash instead of cmd prompt
-it worked in bash

Made some changes to cmder config to see if I could push changes without having to use password everytime using cmder
-didn't work..

Maybe you have to type in the password at least once before it's automatic?
-didn't work

Noticed I uncommented the wrong lines in the cmder config file (used paegent instead of ssh agent)
-SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
