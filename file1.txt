added 2nd line of text to file 1

another change after making remote repo!!!

This change was made via the website to test fetching and merging
-fetch will bring in new changes others made from REMOTE but won't change my working code base

Let's do one more test (this was added via website)
-if I don't fetch+MERGE before trying to push github will yell at me
-error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:danhlee/git-fundamentals.git'
-hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
